            Atmospheric maze game export constrained by the 64 x 64 resolution.

            Assets made in Blender. 
            Most of the two weeks were spent learning modelling techniques; 
            as such, some desired game mechanics could not be implemented in time.

        <p>
            My first game: a 2D top-down shooter, initially intended to 
            be a dynamic tower-defense game, where the players 
            can move and shoot towers independently.
            <hr></hr>
            I learnt invaluable lessons about the limitations of design appetite, 
            especially within the confines of a tight deadline.
