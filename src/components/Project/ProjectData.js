        <p>
            2D puzzle-platformer game based on the central mechanic of folding platforms in 
            order to solve puzzles and progress through levels. 
            <hr></hr>
            Progressively introduces items and hazards that react with the environment, 
            resulting in interesting and dynamic puzzle solving that increase in difficulty.
